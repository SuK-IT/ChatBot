# 1. ChatBot

## 1.1 About

ChatBot is a keyword-recognition-based Bot.
The backend is written in Java, using Spring Boot to deploy a webservice. 
The frontend is written in Quasar, a VueJS framework, using TypeScript instead of plain JS to ensure typesafety.

This is a small project for vocational school.

## 1.2 Building

To build the project and receive an executable exe/jar, execute 
`./gradlew about installQuasar cleanFrontend assembleFrontend copyDist build createExe --info`
from the main directory of this repository. After the execution finishes, you'll have your `ChatBot.exe` and `ChatBot-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar`
available in the `build/libs`-directory.  3

## 1.3 Deploying

### 1.3.1 JAR

Deploying ChatBot from the JAR-file can be done by downloading the latest release from [the releases page](https://github.com/SuK-IT/ChatBot/releases/latest)
and executing it in any directory with `java -jar ChatBot-x.x.x.jar` where `x.x.x` represents the version you downloaded. Afterwards, head to `http://localhost:8080` in
your favorite webbrowser and you're good to go!
