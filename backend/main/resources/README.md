# ChatBot

## About

ChatBot is a keyword-recognition-based Bot.
The backend is written in Java, using Spring Boot to deploy a webservice. 
The frontend is written in Quasar, a VueJS framework, using TypeScript instead of plain JS to ensure typesafety.

This is a small project for vocational school.

## Building

To build the project and receive an executable exe/jar, execute 
`./ gradlew about installQuasar cleanFrontend assembleFrontend copyDist build createExe --info`
from the main directory of this repository. After the execution finishes, you'll have your `ChatBot.exe` and `ChatBot-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar`
available in the `build/libs`-directory.
